## Meet Kuai
Hi, I’m Kuai, the creator of CodeSpree! With over a decade of experience in tech and finance, I’ve worked at [Google](https://about.google/), [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), and [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/), tackling complex engineering challenges and leading high-performing teams. Currently, I’m a Director of Engineering at [Nium](https://nium.com/), a fintech unicorn. I joined as the founding engineer in the US and scaled the engineering team from 1 person to 4 teams within two years.

Outside of my professional work, I’m deeply passionate about mentoring. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of supporting software engineers and managers in advancing their careers. Many of my mentees have gone on to secure roles at companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Citadel, and Two Sigma.

CodeSpree is my way of sharing that passion with a broader audience. I believe learning should be accessible, practical, and enjoyable.

Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuai) and keep learning together!
