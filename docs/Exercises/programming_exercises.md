Return true if such a match exists, otherwise false.

**Examples:**
```
Input: s = "abanana", p = "b*na"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' can match "ana", giving "banana" which is a substring of "abanana".

Input: s = "aaaa", p = "b*a"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no substring in "aaaa" that starts with 'b'. Hence, no match.

Input: s = "luck", p = "u*"

## Problem 51: Truncated Mean

Write a function to calculate the truncated mean of a list of integers. The truncated mean is the average of the numbers in the list after removing the smallest and largest values. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest or largest value, only one instance of each is removed.  
Assume that the size of the input array is at least three.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 4
Explanation: Removing the smallest (2) and largest (6) values leaves [3, 4, 5].
The mean is (3 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 4.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]

Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the pivot integer since 1 = 1

Input: 15
Output: -1
Explanation: No such integer exist
```

Your task is to return the [alphabetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order) smallest string that can be obtained by performing exactly one swap operation on the string.

**Examples:**
```
Input: "deed"
Output: "dede"

Input: "abcd"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: Any swap would result in a alphabetically larger string

Input: "alphabet"
Output: "alhpabet"
```

## Problem 55: Word Chain

A list of words is valid if each word starts with the last letter of the previous word. Write a function to check if the given sequence of words is valid.  
Assume the words are case-insensitive.

**Examples:**
```
Input: ["hello", "orange", "elephant", "tree"]
Output: True
Explanation: "hello" -> "orange" -> "elephant" -> "tree".

Input: ["cat", "dog", "pig", "goat"]
Output: False
Explanation: "dog" does not start with "t".

Input: ["Apple", "Elephant", "tiger"]
Output: True
Explanation: Case is ignored, so "Apple" -> "Elephant" -> "tiger" is valid.

Input: ["zebra"]
Output: True
Explanation: A single word is trivially valid.

Input: []
Output: True
Explanation: An empty list is trivially valid.
```

Output: 9 - 8 + 7 - 6 = 2
```

---

## Problem 59: Palindromic Chain

A sequence of words is a **palindromic chain** if the words form a palindrome when read as a continuous sentence (ignoring spaces and punctuation). Write a function to check if a list of words forms a palindromic chain.

**Examples:**
```
Input: ["madam", "im", "adam"]
Output: True
Explanation: Combining the words gives "madamimadam", which is a palindrome.

Input: ["hello", "world"]
Output: False
Explanation: "helloworld" is not a palindrome.

Input: ["race", "car"]
Output: True
Explanation: "racecar" is a palindrome.
```

## Problem 60: Longest Increasing Subarray

A **subarray** is a _contiguous_ portion of an array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` are subarrays, but `[1, 3]` is not because the elements are not contiguous.

Write a function to find the length of the longest subarray in a list of integers where the elements are strictly increasing.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarray [1, 2, 3] is the longest increasing subarray.

Input: [5, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarray [1, 2, 3] is the longest.
```

## Problem 61: Peak Indices

You are given a 0-indexed integer array, `nums`. You need to find all indices `i` (except the first and last) such that `nums[i] > nums[i - 1]` and `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [1, 4, 3, 8, 5]
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: nums[0] and nums[4] cannot be peaks because they are
the first and last elements. nums[1] and nums[3] are strictly greater
than their neighboring elements.

Input: [2, 4, 4]
Output: []
Explanation: nums[0] and nums[2] cannot be peaks because they are
the first and last elements. nums[1] also can not be a peak because
it is not strictly greater than nums[2].

Input: [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
Output: [2]

Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [2]
```

---

## Problem 62: Longest Monotonic Subarray

You are given a 0-indexed integer array, `nums`. A subarray is a contiguous portion of the array. We say a subarray is:

* Strictly Increasing if each element is greater than the one before it.
* Strictly Decreasing if each element is less than the one before it.

Your task is to find the length of the longest subarray that is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [2, 2, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: No two consecutive elements are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing,
so the longest valid subarray is just any single element.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The entire array [1, 2, 3, 4] is strictly increasing.

Input: [5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 10]
Output: 4
Explanation: [6, 5, 4, 3] is strictly decreasing (length 4).

Input: [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]
Output: 3
```

## Problem 64: Largest Positive Integer With Its Negative

You are given an integer array `nums` (which contains no zero). Your task is to find the largest positive integer `k` such that both `k` and `-k` exist in `nums`. If no such integer exists, return `-1`.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [-1, 10, 6, 7, -7, 1]
Output: 7

Input: [-10, 8, 6, 7, -2, -3, 8]
Output: -1

Input: [-3, -2, 2, 3]
Output: 3
```

## Problem 65: Desk Phone Transfer

There are `n` desks in a row, labeled from 0 to `n-1`. At time `0`, desk `0` receives an important phone call. Each second, the call is transferred to the next desk in ascending order. Once it reaches the last desk (`n-1`), it reverses direction and moves back toward desk `0`. This back-and-forth pattern continues indefinitely. Given a time `k` (in seconds), determine which desk the call is at exactly at time `k`.

**Examples:**
```
Input: n = 4, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Desks are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3. At each second:
  Time 0: Desk 0
  Time 1: Desk 1
  Time 2: Desk 2
  Time 3: Desk 3
  Time 4: Desk 2
  Time 5: Desk 1
After 5 seconds, the call is at desk 1.

Input: n = 3, k = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: Desks are labeled 0, 1, 2. At each second:
  Time 0: Desk 0
  Time 1: Desk 1
  Time 2: Desk 2
  Time 3: Desk 1
  Time 4: Desk 0
  Time 5: Desk 1
  Time 6: Desk 2
  Time 7: Desk 1
After 7 seconds, the call is at desk 1.
```

## Problem 66: Perfect Square

Given an `n x n` grid where each cell contains an integer from `1` to `n`, determine whether **every row** and **every column** contains **all** integers from `1` to `n`.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [[1, 2, 3], [3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]]
Output: True
Explanation: In this case, n = 3, and every row and column contains the
numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Input: [[1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]]
Output: False
Explanation: In this case, n = 3, but the first row has a repeated 2.
