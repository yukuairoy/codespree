## Problem 54: Smallest String After One Swap

You are given a string `str`. In one operation, you can swap any two characters at adjacent positions.
Your task is to return the [alphabetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order) smallest string that can be obtained by performing exactly one swap operation on the string.

**Examples**
```plaintext
Input: "deed"
Output: "dede"

Input: "abcd"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: Any swap would result in a alphabetically larger string

Input: "alphabet"
Output: "alhpabet"
```

## Problem 55: Word Chain

A list of words is valid if each word starts with the last letter of the previous word. Write a function to check if the given sequence of words is valid.  
Assume the words are case-insensitive.

**Examples**

```plaintext
Input: ["hello", "orange", "elephant", "tree"]
Output: True
Explanation: "hello" -> "orange" -> "elephant" -> "tree".

Input: ["cat", "dog", "pig", "goat"]
Output: False
Explanation: "dog" does not start with "t".

Input: ["Apple", "Elephant", "tiger"]
Output: True
Explanation: Case is ignored, so "Apple" -> "Elephant" -> "tiger" is valid.

Input: ["zebra"]
Output: True
Explanation: A single word is trivially valid.

Input: []
Output: True
Explanation: An empty list is trivially valid.
```

## Problem 56: Detect Cyclic Words

Write a function to check if two strings are cyclic permutations of each other. Two strings are cyclic permutations if one string can be rotated to match the other.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "deabc"
Output: True
Explanation: Rotating "deabc" gives "abcde".

Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "lohel"
Output: True

Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "lolhe"
Output: False
```

## Problem 57: Find Missing Page Number

Imagine you are given a book where pages are labeled from 1 toÂ  n , but one page is missing. Write a function to find the missing page number from a given list of page numbers.  
Assume the input is _sorted_.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
Output: 5

Input: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 1
```

**Bonus:** Can we solve this problem faster than linear time?

## Problem 58: Alternating Sum of Digits

Write a function to calculate the alternating sum of digits in an integer. Alternate between adding and subtracting each digit from left to right.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
Input: 12345
Output: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 = 3

Input: 9876
Output: 9 - 8 + 7 - 6 = 2
```

## Problem 59: Palindromic Chain

A sequence of words is a **palindromic chain** if the words form a palindrome when read as a continuous sentence (ignoring spaces and punctuation). Write a function to check if a list of words forms a palindromic chain.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
Input: ["madam", "im", "adam"]
Output: True
Explanation: Combining the words gives "madamimadam", which is a palindrome.

Input: ["hello", "world"]
Output: False
Explanation: "helloworld" is not a palindrome.

Input: ["race", "car", "race"]
Output: True
Explanation: "racecarrace" is a palindrome.
```

## Problem 60: Longest Increasing Subarray

A **subarray** is a _contiguous_ portion of an array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` are subarrays, but `[1, 3]` is not because the elements are not contiguous.

Write a function to find the length of the longest subarray in a list of integers where the elements are strictly increasing.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarray [1, 2, 3] is the longest increasing subarray.

Input: [5, 1, 2, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarray [1, 2, 3] is the longest.
```
