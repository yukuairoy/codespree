**Examples:**
```
Input: [1, 4, 3, 8, 5]
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: nums[0] and nums[4] cannot be peaks because they are
the first and last elements. nums[1] and nums[3] are strictly greater
than their neighboring elements.

Input: [2, 4, 4]
Output: []
Explanation: nums[0] and nums[2] cannot be peaks because they are
the first and last elements. nums[1] also can not be a peak because
it is not strictly greater than nums[2].

Output: [2]

Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [2]
```

---

## Problem 38: Cyclic Shifting

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Your task is to shift the characters of the string `s` cyclically to the right by `k` positions. If the end of the string is reached during the shift, wrap around to the beginning.

Write a function that takes `s` and `k` as input and returns the resulting string after the cyclic shift.

**Examples:**
```
Input: s = "hello", k = 2
Output: "llohe"
Explanation:
  For i = 0, the 2nd character after 'h' is 'l'.
  For i = 1, the 2nd character after 'e' is 'l'.
  For i = 2, the 2nd character after 'l' is 'o'.
  For i = 3, the 2nd character after 'l' is 'h'.
  For i = 4, the 2nd character after 'o' is 'e'.

Input: s = "abcdef", k = 4
Output: "efabcd"
Explanation:
  For i = 0, the 4th character after 'a' is 'e'.
  For i = 1, the 4th character after 'b' is 'f'.
  For i = 2, the 4th character after 'c' is 'a'.
  For i = 3, the 4th character after 'd' is 'b'.
  For i = 4, the 4th character after 'e' is 'c'.
  For i = 5, the 4th character after 'f' is 'd'.

Input: s = "xxxx", k = 1
Output: "xxxx"
```

---

## Problem 39: Matrix Diagonal Sum

You are given a square matrix `mat` of size $n \times n$. Your task is to return the sum of the matrix diagonals.  
- Include the primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
- If the same element is on both diagonals (e.g., the center of an odd-sized matrix), only count it once.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output: 25
Explanation:
- Primary diagonal: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
- Secondary diagonal: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
- Since the center element (5) is counted twice, subtract it once: 15 + 15 - 5 = 25.

Input: [
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1]
]
Output: 8
Explanation:
- Primary diagonal: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
- Secondary diagonal: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
- No overlap since the matrix has an even size.
Total: 4 + 4 = 8

Input: [[5]]
Output: 5
```

```
Input: [3, 2, 3]
Output: 3

Input: [4, 8, 10, 8, 8, 8, 4]
Output: 8
```

---

## Problem 44: Longest Monotonic Subarray

You are given a 0-indexed integer array, `nums`. A subarray is a contiguous portion of the array. We say a subarray is:

* Strictly Increasing if each element is greater than the one before it.
* Strictly Decreasing if each element is less than the one before it.

Your task is to find the length of the longest subarray that is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [2, 2, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: No two consecutive elements are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing,
so the longest valid subarray is just any single element.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The entire array [1, 2, 3, 4] is strictly increasing.

Input: [5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 10]

## Problem 45: Perfect Square

Given an `n x n` grid where each cell contains an integer from `1` to `n`, determine whether **every row** and **every column** contains **all** integers from `1` to `n`.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [[1, 2, 3], [3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]]
Output: True
Explanation: In this case, n = 3, and every row and column contains the
numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Input: [[1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]]
Output: False
Explanation: In this case, n = 3, but the first row has a repeated 2.
```

## Problem 46: Largest Sum of Non-Adjacent Numbers

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of two non-adjacent numbers.

**Examples:**  
```
Input: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Output: 12 (4+8)

Input: [5, 1, 1, 5]
Output: 10 (5+5)
```

## Problem 47: Array Rotation

Rotate an array by `k` positions to the right.

**Examples:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
Output: [3, 4, 1, 2]

Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], k = 3
Output: [30, 40, 50, 10, 20]

Input: [1, 2, 3], k = 0
Output: [1, 2, 3]

Input: [1, 2, 3], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 3]

Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], k = 1
Output: [50, 10, 20, 30, 40]

Input: [], k = 3
Output: []

Input: [7, 8, 9], k = 10
Output: [9, 7, 8]
```

## Problem 48: Largest Alphabetical Rotation

Given a string `s`, generate all rotations (cyclic shifts) of `s` and return the **lexicographically largest** rotation.

**Examples:**
```
Input: "abc"
Output: "cab"

Input: "zab"
Output: "zab"
```

## Problem 49: Sort by Age

Given two arrays - one containing `names` and another containing corresponding `ages` - write a function to sort people by their ages in _descending_ order. Return the sorted list of names.  
Assume the values of `ages` are distinct.

**Examples:**
```
Input: names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], ages = [24, 45, 70]
Output: ["Charlie", "Bob", "Alice"]

Input: names = ["Mark", "Emma", "Alex", "Sarah"], ages = [75, 18, 41, 65]
Output: ["Mark", "Sarah", "Alex", "Emma"]
```

## Problem 50: Partition String into Fixed-Size Groups

Given a string `s`, an integer `k`, and a fill character `fill`, partition `s` into groups of size `k`. If the length of `s` is not a multiple of `k`, pad the final group with the fill character until it has size `k`. Return all the groups as a list of strings.

**Examples:**
```
Input: s = "hello", k = 2, fill = "*" 
Output: ["he", "ll", "o*"]
Explanation: The remainder has only 'o', so we add one '*' to form a group of size 2.

Input: s = "abcd123", k = 3, fill = "-"
Output: ["abc", "d12", "3--"]
Explanation: String length is 7, so we need 2 fill characters '-' to complete the last group.
```
