# Managing Imports

Python modules are reusable pieces of code that allow you to logically organize your programs. Modules can define functions, classes, and variables, or include runnable code. Using the `import` statement, you can include these modules in your scripts, accessing their functionality without rewriting code.

---

## Syntax

To import a module, use the `import` statement. Here are a few examples:

```python
import math  # Imports the entire math module
from collections import Counter  # Imports only the Counter class from the collections module
import numpy as np  # Imports the numpy module and gives it an alias as np
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Using the `os` Module

The `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as managing files and directories.

```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current Directory: {current_directory}")

# List files and directories in the current directory
entries = os.listdir(current_directory)
print(f"Contents of Directory: {entries}")

# Create a new directory
os.mkdir('example_dir')
print("Created a new directory named 'example_dir'")
```

### Example 2: Using the `math` Module

The `math` module provides access to mathematical constants and functions.

```python
import math

# Calculate the square root of a number
number = 16
sqrt_number = math.sqrt(number)
print(f"The square root of {number} is {sqrt_number}")

# Calculate the value of pi
print(f"The value of pi is {math.pi}")

# Calculate the sine of an angle (in radians)
angle = math.radians(30)  # Convert degrees to radians
sine_value = math.sin(angle)
print(f"The sine of 30 degrees is {sine_value}")
```

### Importing Specific Functions or Classes

To avoid prefixing module names every time, import specific components directly:

```python
from math import sqrt, pi

# Using imported functions directly
print(f"The square root of 25 is {sqrt(25)}")
print(f"The value of pi is approximately {pi}")
```

### Aliasing Modules

For long module names or commonly used libraries, aliasing makes code more concise and readable.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array using numpy
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Numpy Array: {array}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Organize imports at the top of the file**: All imports should be placed at the beginning of the script for clarity and maintainability.
2. **Avoid wildcard imports**: Instead of `from module import *`, import only the components you need for clarity and to avoid conflicts.
3. **Use aliases for readability**: For example, `import numpy as np`.
4. **Group imports logically**:
     * Standard library imports (e.g., `math`, `os`).
     * Third-party library imports (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`).
     * Custom module imports.
